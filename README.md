This tic tac toe game has a He-Man theme, which as some of you fans might know has recently been the center of a copyright battle between Sony pictures and Matel.   Thanks Matel for fighting the good fight and for staying relatively cool with fair use image laws, so I don't feel bad about pulling some cartoon jpeg clips from various blog sources like this one:

The voice of He-Man is of course the one and only Dolph Lungren from the 1980's Masters of Universe film.

I used a combo of HTML, Java Script, JQuery, AJAX and CSS to get this page going.

I'd like to make the sound more dynamic with some skelator and have the file ready as soon as learn how to do that.  In the assets folder, I made a Construction folder where you can images taken from my sketchbook that explain my game logic and illustrate some of the game design plans.

I'd like to call my method "brute forcing around my ass to get to my elbow."
